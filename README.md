Bash scripts and ideas I'm working on

Alsachange.sh is a simple bash menu that give's the option to copy 1 of 2 alsarc config files then restart Alsa depending on your needs

.asoundrcjack uses hardware settings of your chosen soundcard 

.asoundrcalsa uses Dmix so multiple sound sources can be played at once
